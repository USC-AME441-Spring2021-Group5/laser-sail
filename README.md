# laser-sail
MATLAB scripts and functions for the simulation of a laser-driven light sail

I suggest pulling the current version of the main scripts before making any edits and pushing to the main branch when finished. If you cannot finish a full working edit when you are done for the time being, you can create a new branch and push to that. Once you are finished integrating your changes and have made them work with the main file, then you can push to the main branch.

There's a pretty solid guide that explains how to navigate and work in this environment, I suggest skimming it if you have trouble.

Ya, I def reccomend reading the guide.
